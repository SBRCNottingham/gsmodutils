gsmodutils basic userguide

-- Introduction --
This is an early draft containing the details of how to use gsmodutils. The future version will be vastly more comprehenisve than this, however, this is more of a place to leave usage notes until I get around to writing something more comprehenisve.

-- Installation --

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install

-- Creating a project --
Creating a project can be run after the installation of gsmodutils.

    gsm_project.py --model <path_to_model_sbml_or_json> --path </path/to/new/repo>

Check gsm_project --help for more usage options.


-- Using/building a docker container --

It is assumed that docker is set up and configured for your os.
This guide only assumes a user will want to build a docker container for their model once, not mount a volume. A more conclusive description of this will come in the future.

To build:
    docker build -t my/model .

To run an ipython shell:
    docker run -i -t my/model ipython -i load_model.py
    
To run tests:

TODO:
    * Sharing a docker container.
    * Make shell scripts for all these commands.
    * Volumes for the docker container of the model developer rather than building on every model change.
    
-- Adding new growth conditions --
The growth conditions file "model_conditions.json" allows the user to add growth conditions which are form part of the test script.
These conditions cannot be easily written in an automated manner, a more complete guide on this will be written.
However, here is an example 
    
    
-- Writing custom test cases --
Good, clearly written test cases are the essence of easy to understand genome scale modelling approaches.

Adding test_<test_group>.py with functions labeled def test_<test_name>():


    
TODO:
    * Figure out good way of saving html py.test outputs
