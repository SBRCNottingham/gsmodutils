gsmodutils - genome scale model management utilities
===========================================================

``gsmodutils`` is a set of utilities that aim to improve the management of large constraints based models geared
towards strain design and analysis.
Think of it as a friendly framework for developing genome scale models.

The core aim of this software is to make genome scale models, and their applications, reusable in future projects.
This is inspired by the notion of *test driven development*.

Changes to models are tracked and pre-written test cases ensure that changes don't break already working components.
In addition, by following good practices, well documented genome scale models can be an accompaniment to papers,
a core goal of ``gsmodutils`` is to allow users to share their projects in self contained ``docker`` images.

**Note that this software is under heavy development and much of this may change. Please check back here**
**or at the git hub repository for updates.**

**It is currently recommended that you install gsmodutils in a** ``virtualenv`` **environment**.


The most important thing, though, is to not have a model file for every small set of constraints that are added to a
model.

E.g. having a directory structure such as this isn't good for anyone. You might add new curation to the base model,
or a knockout might exist in one model but not another.

.. code-block:: guess

    $ ls my_project
    ecoli_base_model.sbml
    ecoli_model_with_xylose_growth.sbml
    ecoli_model_with_fructose_growth.sbml
    ecoli_model_with_succinate_production.sbml
    ecoli_model_with_succinate_production_on_xylose.sbml
    ...
    ecoli_model_with_succinate_production_on_xylose_JUNE_2015_PUBLISHED_VERSION.sbml


Instead ``gsmodutils`` takes the philopsophy that we should be storing the changes (ie. *diffs* or *deltas*) between
different versions of models.
For this reason, gsmodutils uses simple utilities that let you load model ``conditions`` and ``designs`` in python:

.. code-block:: python

    from gsmodutils import GSMProject
    project = GSMProject()
    # Just load a model
    model = project.load_model()
    # Just load some conditions
    xylose_growth = project.load_conditions('xylose_growth')
    # Load a strain design
    succ_prod = project.load_design('succinate_production')
    # or load it growing on a different substrate
    succ_prod_xyl = project.load_design('succinate_production', conditions='xylose_growth')


Or you can export them through the convenient command line utility to export models for use in other tools outside the
cobrapy world.

.. code-block:: guess

    $ gsmodutils export matlab succ_production.m --design succinate_production --conditions xylose_growth


Installation
------------
To install, the simplest method is to use pip (FUTURE VERSION)

.. code-block:: guess

    $ pip install gsmodutils

Alternatively, install a developement version using a virtual environment

.. code-block:: guess

    $ pip install virtualenv
    $ virtualenv ~/gsmodenv
    $ source ~/gsmodenv/bin/activate
    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:nottingham_sbrc/gsmodutils.git
    $ cd gsmodutils
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -e .


If installed in this manner, you must activate the virtualenv whenever you wish to use the tools. For example:

.. code-block:: guess

    $ gsmodutils info
    gsmodutils: command not found
    $ source ~/gsmodenv/bin/activate
    $ gsmodutils info
    ...

gsmodutils has been developed for python 2.7 and python 3.5+.
Older versions of python are not supported.

Check your python version with:

.. code-block:: guess

    $ python --version

If using MacOS and your version of python is outdated, it is recomended that you use hombrew
( https://brew.sh ) and then install pip:

.. code-block:: guess

    $ brew install python

If you have python, but not pip easy_install should work:

.. code-block:: guess

    $ sudo easy_install pip
    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

For windows users, follow the guides on installing python and pip from the python website.

User guides
------------
Project creation is the first step. This can be done as simply

.. code-block:: guess

    $ gsmodutils create_project PROJECT_PATH MODEL_PATH

This will give a step by step guide.

Other utilities
---------------
gsmodutils also includes utilities for genome scale model managament.
Particularly the parsing of ScrumPy files (constraints based models developed at oxford brookes university).
